## The Problem

Selling on Facebook Marketplace or eBay? You've probably asked: *"What should I price this for?"*

Existing tools only track Amazon prices — they don't help with **local marketplaces** where pricing varies by region, condition, and demand.

## The Solution

Upload a photo, describe your item, and get an instant AI-powered price recommendation based on:

- **Hyperlocal market data** — What items actually sell for in your area
- **Condition-based adjustments** — Fair prices for new, used, and refurbished
- **Real-time market signals** — Supply and demand in your region
